# StringExtract
CakePHP component to extract between two keywords

This is a fun experiment that [extracts text between two words](https://www.endyourif.com/stringextractcomponent-for-cakephp/).
It has been implemented as a [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org) component but in theory could be re-used elsewhere.
